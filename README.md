# BIOE-Script
This file was created for my boss while working in the Bioengineering department at University of Illinois at Chicago. It is a simple PowerShell script that would take the contents of a webpage and completely copy it over to another file that was constantly being updated and projected onto a screen in the hallway. The screen consisted of a slideshow and the file we were changing was of a current seminar that was happening sometime that week.
